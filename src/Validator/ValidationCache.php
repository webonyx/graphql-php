/**
 * Implement this interface and pass an instance to GraphQL::executeQuery to enable caching of successful query validations.
 *
 * This can improve performance by skipping validation for known-good combinations of query, schema, and rules.
 * You are responsible for defining how cache keys are computed.
 *
 * Some things to keep in mind when generating keys:
 * - PHP's `serialize()` function is fast, but can't handle certain structures such as closures.
 * - If your `$schema` includes closures or is too large or complex to serialize,
 *   consider using a build-time version number or environment-based fingerprint instead.
 * - Keep in mind that there are internal `$rules` that are applied in addition to any you pass in,
 *   and it's possible these may shift or expand as the library evolves,
 *   so it might make sense to include the library version number in your keys.
 *
 * @see PsrValidationCacheAdapter for a simple reference implementation.
