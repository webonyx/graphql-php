# Contributing to GraphQL PHP

## Workflow
If your contribution requires significant or breaking changes, or if you plan to propose a major new feature,
we recommend you to create an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php/issues) with
a brief proposal and discuss it with us first.

For smaller contributions just use this workflow:

* Fork the project.
* Add your features and or bug fixes.
* Add tests. Tests are important for us.
* Check your changes using `composer check`.
* Add an entry to the [Changelog's Unreleases section](CHANGELOG.md#unreleased).
* Send a pull request.

## Setup the Development Environment
First, copy the URL of your fork and `git clone` it to your local machine.

```sh
cd graphql-php
composer install
```

## Running tests
```sh
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Some tests have annotation `@see it('<description>')`. It is used for reference to same tests in [graphql-js implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) with the same description.

## Coding Standard
The coding standard of this project is based on [Doctrine CS](https://github.com/doctrine/coding-standard).

Run the inspections:
```sh
./vendor/bin/phpcs
```

Apply automatic code style fixes:
```sh

```

## Static analysis
Based on [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).
```sh
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --ansi --memory-limit 256M
